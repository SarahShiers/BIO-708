## **Research Proposal: Geographical Variation of Risso's Dolphins (_Grampus griseus_) in the California Current**

**Overview**

This repository houses the research proposal centered on Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus), which are part of the delphinid family and have documented populations in the California Current. The proposal seeks to investigate the ecology of this species, including its population boundaries and distribution within this specific region, especially concerning the potential environmental impacts of offshore wind energy development along the U.S. West Coast.

**Objectives**
* Investigate the population boundaries of Risso's dolphins within the California Current.
* Analyze their vocalizations using passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) and identify distinct patterns on spectrograms and long-term spectral averages (LTSAs).
* Focus on data collected from central Oregon to Central California to understand geographic variation and underlying environmental factors.

**Data Collection**

Data for this project is collected through:
* Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM)

**Methodolgy**
* Analyzing echolocation click variations within the populations of Risso's dolphins in the California Current.
* Utilizing spectrograms and spectral plots to identify unique vocalization patterns.

**Importance**

Gaining knowledge about the ecology and behavior of Risso's dolphins in the California Current is essential, particularly in light of the upcoming development of offshore wind energy sites. This research will offer valuable insights into possible environmental effects and support conservation initiatives for this species in the area.
